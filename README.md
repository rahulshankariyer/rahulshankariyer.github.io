# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Case Studies - By Rahul Shankar Iyer

Hi, I’m Rahul Shankar Iyer. I had recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate – a rigorous , hands-on program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis process. As part of my Data Analytics course, I had worked on two Case Studies. In one case study, I had generated insights from cyclist data in order to give recommendations to Cyclistic, a bike sharing company, on how they can turn casual bike riders into member riders. In another case study, I used fitness data provided by Fitbit users to influence the marketing strategy of Bellabeat for their products. Below, I will go through the various steps in each of my case studies.

# Project 1 - Cyclistic Bike Sharing Data

# Scenario

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

# Project 2 - Bellabeat Customer Data
