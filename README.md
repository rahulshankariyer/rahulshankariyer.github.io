# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Case Studies - By Rahul Shankar Iyer

Hi, I’m Rahul Shankar Iyer. I had recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate – a rigorous , hands-on program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis process. As part of my Data Analytics course, I had worked on two Case Studies. In one case study, I had generated insights from cyclist data in order to give recommendations to Cyclistic, a bike sharing company, on how they can turn casual bike riders into member riders. In another case study, I used fitness data provided by Fitbit users to influence the marketing strategy of Bellabeat for their products. Below, I will go through the various steps in each of my case studies.

Project 1 - Cyclistic Bike Sharing Data



Project 2 - Bellabeat Customer Data
