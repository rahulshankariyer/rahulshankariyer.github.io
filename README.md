# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Case Studies - By Rahul Shankar Iyer

Hi, I’m Rahul Shankar Iyer. I had recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate – a rigorous , hands-on program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis process. As part of my Data Analytics course, I had worked on two Case Studies. In one case study, I had generated insights from cyclist data in order to give recommendations to Cyclistic, a bike sharing company, on how they can turn casual bike riders into member riders. In another case study, I used fitness data provided by Fitbit users to influence the marketing strategy of Bellabeat for their products. Below, I will go through the various steps in each of my case studies.

# Project 1 - Cyclistic Bike Sharing Data

## Scenario

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

# Project 2 - Bellabeat Customer Data

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of
Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat
executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy

Using SQL, I collected data to look into two cases: <br>
1. Whether or not people sleep during the day and if they do, what are their sleeping patterns <br>
2. An analysis of user activity based upon the time of the day and the day of the week <br>
