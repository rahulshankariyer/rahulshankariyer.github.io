# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Case Studies - By Rahul Shankar Iyer

Hi, I’m Rahul Shankar Iyer. I had recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate – a rigorous , hands-on program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis process. As part of my Data Analytics course, I had worked on two Case Studies. In one case study, I had generated insights from cyclist data in order to give recommendations to Cyclistic, a bike sharing company, on how they can turn casual bike riders into member riders. In another case study, I used fitness data provided by Fitbit users to influence the marketing strategy of Bellabeat for their products. Below, I will go through the various steps in each of my case studies.

# Project 1 - Bike Sharing Data from Cyclistic, Chicago

## Scenario

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

Using SQL, the average ride length was calculated based on rider type - member or casual - as well as day of the week. The graphs were generated using R Programming and Tableau. Please click on the below link to view the data

The total number of riders by rider type on each day of the week was calculated using R Programming. Please find the graph in the below link.

Monthly Stats of both member and casual riders were generated using SQL and stored in an excel sheet. Please refer to them in the below link

# Project 2 - Bellabeat Customer Data

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of
Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat
executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy

Using R Programming, the following relationships were plotted: <br>
•Steps Taken in a Day vs Sedentary Minutes <br>
•Total Minutes Asleep vs Total Time in Bed <br>

Click the below links for data of each:

Using SQL, I collected data to look into two cases: <br>
1. Whether or not people sleep during the day and if they do, what are their sleeping patterns <br>
2. An analysis of user activity based upon the time of the day and the day of the week <br>

Based on the daily sleep data collected for each user, I used Tableau to make a graph on how many days each user has used the fitness tracker to track sleeping data as well as the sleep patterns of the users based on how frequently they are using the tracker. They area available in the below links.

# Final Year Project 2018-2019 - Application of Discriminant Analysis for Predicting Medical Diagnosis in Decision Support System 

In this project, I had used 20 clinical attributes for Diabetes, 9 clinical attributes for Cancer and 23 for Herbal Plants to predict their medical diagnosis. Using MATLAB, I had applied several hybrid versions of the KNN and Discriminant Analysis algorithms (listed below) to carry out the predictions for each of them and computed their accuracy.

1. KNN
2. LDA
3. QDA
4. KNN LDA
5. KNN QDA
6. FUZZY KNN
7. FUZZY KNN LDA
8. FUZZY KNN QDA
9. ROUGH FUZZY KNN
10. ROUGH FUZZY KNN LDA
11. ROUGH FUZZY KNN QDA
12. CONDENSED KNN
13. CONDENSED KNN LDA
14. CONDENSED KNN QDA
15. CONSTRAINED KNN
16. CONSTRAINED KNN LDA
17. CONSTRAINED KNN QDA

In the below link, you can find the MATLAB code for some of the algorithms as well as their accuracies

# Analysis of Accident Victims Evaluation by Four Different Hospitals

With the help of leading doctors, I researched and compared the initial evaluation of four leading local hospitals - Mess, Ganga, LSI, OTA - in diagnosing the salvaging or amputation of the limbs of accident victims

The excel sheet in the following link contains 225 observations of accident victims from each of the 4 mentioned hospitals with the following data:
1. Age
2. Gender
3. Probability of salvaging the limbs
4. Probability of  primary amputation being required
5. Probability of  secondary amputation being required
6. Final Diagnosis

<a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YYBLJnrLSgD7jOrTILs2tOJVsBsBlw-4/edit#gid=1215070420"> Original Hospital Data from Ganga, LSI, Mess and OTA Hospitals </a>

Since the prediction of the final diagnosis is given in terms of probabilities, we have made our predictions of salvaging and amputation into binary by assuming the prediction to be salvaged for any salvage probability above a certain cut off value. The probability of amputation was considered as the total probability of primary and secondary to make things simpler. In this case, we choose 6 cut off values - 0.92, 0.88, 0.87, 0.80, 0.70, 0.65

The excel sheet in the above link also contains the count of True Positives(TP), True Negatives(TN), False Positives(FP) and False Negative(FN) cases for each hospital. 

1. True Positives(TP) - The patient's limbs were correctly evaluated as salvaged.
2. True Negatives(TN) - The patient's limbs were correctly evaluated as amputated.
3. False Positives(FP) - The patient's limbs were incorrectly evaluated as salvaged.
4. False Negatives(FN) - The patient's limbs were incorrectly evaluated as amputated.

Using the TP, TN, FP & FN, the sensitivity of TP% was plotted against the specificity of TN% for the descending order of probability of salvage. This is shown in the excel sheets in the below links, which contain the data for each of the hospital, their cut off based calculations of TP, TN, FP & FN, as well as the graphs of TP% against TN%

## Conclusion


Results showed that the Ganga hospital was better than the other hospitals in the evaluation at salvaging or amputating limbs. LSI is second best at evaluation, going by the graphs, behind Mess and OTA only in the 0.70 cut off. Mess is better OTA in 4 out of the 6 cut offs under consideration, behind only in the 0.92 and 0.70 cut offs.
